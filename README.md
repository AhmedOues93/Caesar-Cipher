# Caesar Cipher 🔐 – JavaScript CLI Project

This project was created as part of my **Fullstack Web Development Bootcamp** (June to November 2025, at WBS Coding School).  
It’s a simple command-line tool that encrypts or decrypts a message using the classic **Caesar Cipher algorithm**.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Understand JavaScript fundamentals  
- Work with strings and characters  
- Use functions, loops, and conditional logic  
- Execute JavaScript code in the terminal (Node.js)  
- Learn how to structure a small command-line project  
- Practice using Git and GitHub for version control  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- JavaScript (Vanilla JS)  
- Node.js (console/terminal)  
- Git & GitHub

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:

#bash
git clone https://github.com/AhmedOues93/Caesar-Cipher.git
cd Caesar-Cipher
Run the script with Node.js:

#bash
Kopieren
Bearbeiten
node caesar-cipher.js

💡 Usage
The program asks you whether you want to encrypt or decrypt a message.

Then you enter the message and the key (shift number).

The program outputs the transformed message in the console.

🔍 How It Works
The Caesar Cipher is a simple substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3:

A → D

B → E

C → F

... and so on.

This tool allows you to encrypt or decrypt messages using this method.

⚠️ Limitations
Only supports English alphabet letters (A-Z, a-z).

Non-alphabet characters are not changed.

Case is preserved (uppercase stays uppercase, lowercase stays lowercase).
